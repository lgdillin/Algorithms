\section{Question 8.2-4}
Describe an algorithm that, given $n$ integers in the range $0$ to $k$, preprocesses its input and then answers any query about how many of the $n$ integers fall into a range $[a..b]$ in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time. Your algorithm should use $\Theta(n+k)$ preprocessing time \\ 
\noindent\rule{2cm}{0.4pt} \\ 

Suppose we have a set of integers, $S$, where the $min(S) = 0$, and $max(S) = k$.  We want an algorithm that can tell how how many integers, $m$ fall in the range $[a,b]$ such that 
$0 \leq a \leq b \leq k$ in time $\mathcal{O}(1)$. \\

Let us observe COUNTING-SORT.  First, we initialize an array of size $k$ such that every element is equal to $0$. Then we populate the array with the frequency in which each element appears.  Then, for any element $j \in [0,k]$, we have another loop to sum the number of elements less than or equal to $j$ with the frequency of $j$.  \\

Note that an array is already ordered by its own index.  Since this is true, then we can count the number of elements $m$ that fall within the range $[a,b]$ by simply iterating across the "counting" array: $m$ += $(C[b]$ downto $C[a])$. Note that the difference between two constants is also a constant. \\

The counting step (building the frequency table) takes $\Theta(n)$ because we must loop over the entire input array, and the frequency step, or "number of elements less than" step takes $\Theta(k)$ because we must loop over the size of the counting array.  Thus the preprocessing step will take $\Theta(n+k)$, and the query step will take $\Theta(b-a)$, or $\mathcal{O}(1)$.

\section{Question 8.3-4}
Show how to sort $n$ integers in the range $0$ to $n^{3} -1$ in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time. \\ 
\noindent\rule{2cm}{0.4pt} \\ 

Note: According to lemma 8.3: "Given $n$ $d$-digit numbers in which each digit can take on up to k possible values, RADIX-SORT correctly sorts these numbers in $\Theta(d(n+k))$ time if the stable sort it uses takes $\Theta(n+k)$ time" \\

Note that our range of values has a ceiling of $n^{3}-1$.  So as $n$ grows without bound, the number of digits grows following $\log_{10} (n^{3})$. \\

if we distribute the $d$ from the equation above, we get $\Theta(dn+dk)$.  Since $d = \log_{10} (n^{3})$, we will have a runtime of $\Theta(nlgn)$. \\

However, if we convert each of our integers to base $n$, then each of our numbers will have at most $\log_{n}(n^{3}) = 3$ digits, and thus will only require 3 passes.  Since each digit has $n$ possible values, we can sort each digit in $\mathcal{O}(3*n) = \mathcal{O}(n)$ time.


\section{Question 8.4-2}
Explain why the worst-case running time for bucket sort is $\Theta(n^{2})$. What simple change to the algorithm preserves its linear average-case running time and makes its worst-case running time $\mathcal{O}(nlgn)$? \\ 
\noindent\rule{2cm}{0.4pt} \\ 

BUCKET-SORT is relatively stable, that is, for all elements within the same bucket, they are in the same order relative to each other as they are in the input array.  In addition, if the entire contents of the input array fall within the same bucket, then we have a single bucket of size $n$.  If these elements are also in reverse order, then we get the worse-case performance from INSERTION-SORT, $\Theta(n^{2})$ \\ 

To resolve this, we could use a faster algorithm such as MERGE-SORT.  However, MERGE-SORT requires partitioning the list into smaller parts, and iterating through the linked-list in order to obtain the midpoint, which would slow the algorithm down, and make it very complex.  \\ 

We can resolve this by inserting a step in which each linkedlist is converted to an array, which adds an overhead, but may provide advantages in certain edge cases, and will give us the the $\mathcal{O}(nlgn)$ runtime we desire.
